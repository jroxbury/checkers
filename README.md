TODO

1) If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.
	*If jump can be made, you MUST take it.

2) Game Over - I have check for if all pieces are gone but not checking if all pieces left are blocked in(checkmate).
