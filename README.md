TODO

1) Need to make function for King Jump Capture Move. (can make multiple(if possible) jumps forward & backwards)

2) If a player is able to make a capture, there is no option -- the jump must be made. If more than one capture is available, the player is free to choose whichever he or she prefers.(Jump must be in same direction if not a king)

3) Game Over - I have check for if all pieces are gone but not checking if all pieces left are blocked in(checkmate).
